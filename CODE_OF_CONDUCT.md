# Social Contract

1.  _What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?_

    * If necessary, involve other team members
    * Explain pros/cons of each stance, discuss further if necessary
    * Get a fellow’s/instructor’s input
      Vote as a last resort

1.  _What does this group do when a member is frustrated?_

    * The frustrated person should first try to step back and switch tasks, get a drink, take a walk, meditate, etc.
    * The frustrated person needs to precisely communicate what is frustrating them with other group member(s)
    * Bring up serious issues with the group. If you feel compelled to talk negatively about a group member with someone else, you should be talking to them about it

1.  _What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with?_

    * Check in with the frustrated person if everything’s ok
    * Discuss what they are frustrated with and ask if there’s anything we could do differently

1.  _Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go._

    * Check in with pokey person if they have any blockers that are slowing them down
    * Communicate if you have any external issues affecting their work

1.  _What does this group do when we merge our work together?_

    * Create new branch locally, commit to new branch, push to github, make a pull request on github, someone else approves it (DM if you need a specific person), if ok merge promptly, otherwise comment, delete branch once merged

1.  _When does this group ask for help?_

    Put in a sincere effort, but if you are dead-ending for more than 15 minutes seek help from the other pair. Same when working with the other pair, bring in a fellow if you continue dead-ending
    If you suspect a higher level issue but are unsure, jot down the time and issue (bug log) and the feeling persists for ~a half hour, seek out help as above

1.  _What strategies do we use before we ask for help?_

    * console.log
    * dev tools
    * docs
    * Google error messages
    * explain the code aloud

1.  _How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?_

    Decide on a daily basis whether we want to pair for the day or switch up w/i the day

1.  _Do members of a pair decide their own norms or does the group have one set of norms for everything? If the latter, what are they?_

    Generally trade-off at natural breaks, at natural commit points

1.  _How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?_

    Occasionally, no obligation. If you do choose to work just be sure to communicate what you do.

1.  _What time does this group have daily stand up?_

    Start of day, ~10:30
